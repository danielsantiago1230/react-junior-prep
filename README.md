# React Junior Prep

## Overview
This repository is part of a week-long project designed to train myself in solving conceptual React problems and coding exercises with a focus on React (using TypeScript). The goal is to solidify my understanding of React's core concepts and practical application.

## Preparation Plan
- Day 1-2: Focus on conceptual questions covering React basics, components, props, state, and lifecycle methods.
- Day 3-4: Dive into coding exercises, starting with simple components and gradually increasing complexity by introducing state management and hooks.
- Day 5: Explore more advanced topics like context API, error boundaries, and optimizing React apps for performance.
- Day 6: Review and refine solutions. Revisit challenging areas and consolidate my understanding.
- Day 7: Final review and organization of the GitHub repository. Revisiting key concepts and exercises.

## Repository Structure
- `/conceptual-questions`: Contains a collection of React-related conceptual questions and their answers, organized by topic.
- `/coding-exercises`: Each subdirectory within this folder represents a coding exercise, including:
  - `README.md`: Describes the exercise, objectives, and any specific requirements.
  - `/src`: Contains the React (TSX) code for the exercise.

## How to Use This Repository
